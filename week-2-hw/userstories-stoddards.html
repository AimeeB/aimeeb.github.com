<li>Lisa, 28: Maid-of-honor planning a wedding dress-rehearsal dinner, needs to know about the space and options for dining and catering such an event at Stoddard's. Of primary importance is how to get in contact with events staff, especially if there isn't a detailed resource online. However, Lisa will need to talk to a real person eventually, and wants needs answers tailored to her event, so starting with real contact is her preference.</li>

<li>Adam, 28: Hipster looking with a cool new spot to impress his friends with a great find for food and beer. Particularly interested in the beer list being (and wanting this information up-to-date), as well as any special events.</li>

<li>Marilyn &amp; Joseph, early 60's: Tourists in Boston for the first time found Stoddard's through yelp. They are most interested in hours and making sure the menu will have something they like. They also want to know about events/live music. Also important are logistics like directions and opening hours.</li></ol>
